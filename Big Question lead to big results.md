  Questions can open the gates to knowledge, but asking the right ones can be quite challenging. Smart questions can be effective in truly understanding problems that can not be explained by people who don’t practice complex thinking like myself. This is important to ask smart questions to challenge yourself to become a better problem solver. To be a smart software engineer, you must apply what you know to your question to construct a more in-depth analysis of the situation. Showing that you are willing to improve your problem-solving skills can help you attract the attendants you are desperately looking for. According to Raymond, the hacking community tends to look for complex questions that test their abilities and knowledge in the field. Creating a smart question can be beneficial to find a solution to a problem while furthering your education in engineering any software.
  
  A question I found in StackOverflow that best represents a not-so-smart question is “Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?” This can seem like a good question to ask and some beginner can find knowledge with the answers given, but this is not a smart question to ask in a community because of the lack of complexity. This problem can be easily solved by using a search engine and is the topic of many useful sites. This question has very few diverse ways of answering the problem and doesn’t challenge the minds of all levels in software engineering. The question was popular in StackOverflow as the population of responses was at a good size, but many of the answers show similarity to one another. Many experts may look away from this because the level of difficulty in the question may process this question as a waste of time. Overall, the insight of looking over many questions was quite an experience. I saw many good questions that show a higher level of thinking as well as some questions that barely show that spark of interest.
