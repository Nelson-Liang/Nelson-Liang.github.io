Lion dance has been a big part of my life for a long time. I started this cultural art around the second grade under Hawaii Lion Dance Association or HLDA and love it ever since. This form of traditional Chinese dance requires two performers to mimic the movement of an animal in a costume, accompanied by instruments. The lion dance is usually performed during Chinese New Year and special occasions such as business opening, birthdays, weddings, etc. The dance is important in Chinese culture because it said that the lion brings good luck and fortune. Lion dancing and software engineering are quite similar to each other. Both arts requires knowledge and experience as well as practices in order to create a successful performance. Lion dance has guidelines to follow much like a programmer coding in a certain language; if you donâ€™t follow them, you will be met with failure and bring shame upon your group.

People can learn a lot from being a student, but they learn even more being a teacher. Over the years, I have gradually made my way to becoming one of the leaders in the association. I currently help lead classes and teach our newer members the ways of the art. I learn that being a leader comes with its challenges. Teaching taught me that you need to be patient and display the capabilities of being a leader. I need to provide direction and purpose and help anyone that struggles to understand. Communication is also present in Lion Dance. We need to communicate with each other to make a decision like any other group. When creating a routine, performers and instrument players need to communicate and work together to make an understanding shows. Every beat signifies a certain move that the lion must take to stay on time. These are the types of performance that are going to push you to pass your physical and mental barriers. Hard work brings people together and I made a lot of good friends not only in the club, but also the community of people that share the same passion. These are the skills that I learn from becoming a lion dancer.
