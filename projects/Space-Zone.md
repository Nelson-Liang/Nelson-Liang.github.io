## Intro
This project is a video game that was created by my team in ICS 111. I choose to share this project because I was proud of the final result. The game achieved everything we wanted while presented everything we learned. The hectic gameplay summarises the amount of coding needed to bring the dream to life. 

## Gameplay
The game had a simple objective: collect all the coins to win while avoiding moving projectiles on the field. The player has three lives at the start of the game, but can gain a live point if the player captures the floating ring flying around. 

## Contribution
For this project, I work on the codes that animate the movement of the controllable character as well as moves the projectiles and coins.  We also implemented code from other Java files and learn how to organize our code to be more presentable. One thing I value is the communication we had during the building process. We collaborated online with each other, sharing thoughts and ideas to make it better while considering each other opinions. This project help me learn team communication and furthering my skills in programming.
