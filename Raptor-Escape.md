 For this project, the prompt was to create several hostile AIs that will chase the player around a constructed room. Both the player and AIs canâ€™t pass through walls and the player only got one life so no error can be made, but players have the ability to teleport to a random location. After teleporting, the portal is left there until the player teleports again. Portal can also be accessible by AIs if they pass through it. The objective of this game is to survive until the timer runs out. I choose to share this project because I consider this to be my first best coding achievement. It was quite challenging, but I have enjoyed the development of this game. For the gameplay, I did find some loopholes that a player can take advantage of and make the game easily winnable, so I added a hostile that can go through walls to keep the players on their toes. 
	This project help improves my coding skills. This project was created using Java. I learn how to set a code to move an image using the keyboard. I learn how to track the area of the image to teleport an image or indicate if the player has been touch. Time management was important when creating a project because there are always distractions and priorities that interfere with your work time. Learning how to ask the right question to help me understand how to write the code to accomplish a certain task. These are some of the things this project has taught me.
