	Javascript is new to me and I never attempt to experience it before starting this class. Javascript is similar to java with very few different coding languages. For example, I notice that Javascript uses less data type than Java as “let” can be used for both “int” and “string”. A strong difference between Java and Javascript is where the language is accessible.  Java can run as a downloadable app or a browser while Javascript only runs in a browser. I feel that Javascript is a great platform for new as well as experienced programmers to conduct tasks or projects. As a software engineer, it would be more comfortable using a platform that is easy to use and understand.
	Athletic software engineering is placing a programmer under stress to see how they perform. This is great in training and exercising the programmer’s ability to perform a task in a certain amount of time given. Workout of the day or simply WOD is a daily exercise to place students under these types of stress. I personally don’t like these exercises because it is proven to be more stressful than enjoyable.I am not a quick thinker when it comes to problem solving and I am not very knowledgeable in the language which is important because time doesn't stop for you so every move counts. I can’t say that WOD are not helpful because the task does test your knowledge and condition students for a career in software engineering. This style of learning can be intense, but it exercises your mind to think faster and show where you stand as a programmer.
