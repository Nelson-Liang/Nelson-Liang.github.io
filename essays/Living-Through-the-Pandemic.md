## Introduction
Over the past few months, Covid-19 terrorize the heart of many countries and it’s airborne nature allows the virus to move like wildfire. This caused nations to take drastic measures to try to stop the spread, but the damage have already been done. Isolation was the key to stopping the spread but at the same time, stopped the flow of civilization around the world. Many lives were affected as many businesses were forced to remain close, leaving the economy in ruin. Traveling industries struggle through the pandemic as restriction and ban placed to stop any movement. 

## Daily Life
The pandemic didn’t affect me as much because of my daily routine. I spend the majority of my day in front of my computer, meaning I may never feel the sunshine unless I have a purpose to step outdoors. Although I enjoy staying indoors, I prefer to leave the house at least once or twice a week. I am still working during these times of social isolation, but I don’t work as much as I used to because of attendance limitation in the office. Both my mom and I have some form of income, however, it is lower than what we usually receive. My community seems to not be affected yet as there are still a few people wandering the blocks and words haven’t broken out yet. I have learned that I took the freedom of outdoor exploration for granted and I realize that when I found myself sleeping a lot and dying from boredom.

## Convertion to Online
Covid-19 has impacted my learning as I can see myself starting to slack even more. My daily schedule became randomize as I tend to not set a curfew for myself which erases the existence of morning in my life. I occasionally set an alarm for online lectures, but I find myself sleeping after dismissing the alarm. Homeworks has not been much of a problem as I submit my assignment in the last hours before the deadline or whenever I finish because I sometimes encounter errors after submission, so I do multiple checks and resubmission. In order to succeed in moving forward with my academics, I need to manage my daily schedule and provide self-motivation and form new study habits. Overall, I hope that we overcome this pandemic and return back to civilization with new knowledge and a healthier mindset.
