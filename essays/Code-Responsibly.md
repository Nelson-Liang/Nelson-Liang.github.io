## Hold Ethical Values 
Without moral principles, you will be living a life without values. Ethics are important to society as it dictated the rights and wrongs of someone’s behavior or action. They serve as a guideline that preserves the definition of what it means to be a good human. The values include showing respect to everyone even if your perspectives are different and taking responsibility for your actions. Software engineers are the pioneer of the future in this modern society. The internet is a revolutionary invention that can be accessed by everyone. It’s a place to borrows for knowledge or even creates something that can change humanity forever. Because of this, software engineer needs to have some code of ethics when creating their vision because today’s world is vulnerable to a skilled artist in the coding language who had a mistake in their security measures or writes with bad intentions. A software engineer must understand the responsibility of their professional work and make ethical decisions to benefit the community.

## Facebook Ethical Issues 
Facebook is a good example that shows a conflict between rights and wrongs. For anyone living under a rock this whole time, Facebook is a website/app that was built to provide a social platform for people to communicate and interacted with each other. What started in America, Facebook dominated the world as users pour in from all around the globe. Users can access the platform with a created account and add friends to share many contents such as pictures, videos, advertisements, news, and much more. The uses of ethics are there as the company intends to create and maintain a positive environment for all of its users. However, Facebook also has a dark side under its friendly face. People have known for some time that the company secretly collects information about every user and hands it to make a profit. This is a good display that the company lacks the value of respecting its user’s privacy. They also lack in the responsibility to provide extra protection on their user’s data. For example, in September of 2017, Russian hackers were able to break into Facebook, exposing many of its users. These are the major flaw in facebook’s ethics, but the company still have good intention and are working hard to improve the system’s security.

## Personal Opinion
Ethics is important with people that have the potential to create a big change to society such as any engineer professions. I believe that software engineers must consider taking precautions when designing and constructing their work and be responsible if anything goes wrong and inflict harm on an individual or the public. Students must be reminded of their ethical duty as a software engineer because they can be easily influenced by someone or their new-found capabilities. Violation of someone’s private data is a great problem as many developers lack the connection with their users. Having ethical guidelines can help reduce this kind of illegal activity.  As long as the practices of ethic’s behaviors remain alive for software engineers as well as other professions, it will help steer humanity in the right direction towards a healthy and positive evolution.
