## Course Overview
This course provided a unique experience to the fundamental of becoming a software engineer. The course exercises many skills that touch every aspect that is needed in the workforce. From time-pressure coding to having an ethical goal and maintain a professional appearance in the codes, I have learned a lot of factors that I can look at and improve to increase my chances to make a good impression in the field. The course mainly focuses on web application development, but many of the materials learned can be carried on to other projects.

## Professionalism
It is important to create an application that beneficial to the users and show quality in the workspace. I wrote an essay that covers ethics in software engineer and discovers the mismanagement of user’s data on social platforms like Facebook. I feel this fundamental is crucial because of the vulnerability that a developer can inflict if they are not mindful of other people. Each software engineer should consider whether or not their application will benefit their user and provide a friendly environment that guaranteed the protection of the user’s privacy. Quality in the workspace is just as important as codes need to be presentable for any colleague or viewers. Code standards are a set of guidelines that make a script of code more organized and readable. These sets of guidelines range from properly indenting an operation of a combination of codes in a subroutine to separating different functions in their own individual pages. These moral principles and coding standards should be used in every project that you commit to.
