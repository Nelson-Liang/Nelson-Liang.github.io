## Course Overview
This course provided a unique experience to the fundamental of becoming a software engineer. The course exercises many skills that touch every aspect that is needed in the workforce. Not only did the course groundwork for coding in Javascript, but it also teaches the mechanics of setting up and operating a coding system that can benefit in a work environment. From time-pressure coding to having an ethical goal and maintain a professional appearance in the codes, I have learned a lot of factors that I can look at and improve to increase my chances to make a good impression in the field. The course mainly focuses on web application development, but many of the materials learned can be carried on to other projects.

## Professionalism
It is important to create an application that beneficial to the users and show quality in the workspace. I wrote an essay that covers ethics in software engineer and discovers the mismanagement of user’s data on social platforms like Facebook. I feel this fundamental is crucial because of the vulnerability that a developer can inflict if they are not mindful of other people. Each software engineer should consider whether or not their application will benefit their user and provide a friendly environment that guaranteed the protection of the user’s privacy. Quality in the workspace is just as important as codes need to be presentable for any colleague or viewers. Code standards are a set of guidelines that make a script of code more organized and readable. These sets of guidelines range from properly indenting an operation of a combination of codes in a subroutine to separating different functions in their own individual pages. These moral principles and coding standards should be used in every project that you commit to. For any profession, you want to have the right mindset when doing your work and be mindful of the co-workers. This is why I think having ethics in your work and valuing quality as much as quantity is important.

## Mastering Management
Projects, like web development, are often required multiple pages fill with coding that works together to display a certain appearance on the screen. This can cause chaos when each developer has different ideas of a goal. When it comes to teamwork, communication is the key to creating a successful product. In this class,  I have learn and practice on agile project management. Agile project management is a method that uses various steps to develop a software application. The main idea for agile management is to break down the project into smaller parts to make the traffic of tasks easier to direct which, in turn, makes the progress of the project less chaotic for everyone on the team. This can be done by leaving notes about tasks and problems that the team or an individual come across when working on the project. Notes should be specific on the objective and updated if the assignment is finished or if a new problem occur. I practice this method during the final project where my team and I created a web application using meteor. We used the project feature in Github to note and track assignments on what you do to achieve the end goal. Outside of this course, this method can be used for anything besides software development, such as construction, business planning, etc.
Agile project management is an important skill to practice in your team when creating software that can possibly change the world.
