	My fascination with technology is what gives me the will to pursue a career in software engineering or somewhere along the line of programming. Technology has been growing rapidly throughout this century, opening humanity to the possibility of constructing new ideas to benefit society. Because of this, I felt the need to be a part of the technological community at a young age and that passion has not left me yet. The software engineer was one of the keys to unlocking the future and push us further than ever before. They are the ones that combine words, numbers, and symbols to make something extraordinary. That is why I want to become a software engineer.

	Software engineer mainly deals with analyzing a problem and find new ways to solve that problem. Programming is challenging because it requires a lot of critical thinking and understanding of the coding language. I was never a complex thinker which lead me to struggle with programming codes on my own. Although I often struggle to learn the language, I never lose hope in improving my skills. My interest in software engineering lies in the end results and the amount of open space to be creative with how you get there. There are so many goals you can achieve and many projects that may seem impossible, but software engineers always find a way to come out with the win. Nothing feels better than a successful project that turns out the way you imagine it to be and that is my drive to continue to improve my programming skills and develop new ones along the way.

	I hope to further my education in the field of software engineering and one day, be knowledgeable enough to be dependable in doing my job to help my team or company I plan to work for. A skill that I want to master is object orientation because it is important for any programming project. Organizing code, setting the correct data type, building function, implementing class, and so much more can help me become a better software engineer. An experience I want to happen is a possible internship for a company. My passion for gaming has placed me to lean towards finding a job in that line of work and I wish to be part of the development of a successful game, but I am open to any job relating to this field. I hope my software engineering class, as well as any of my computer courses in the future, can take me to a new height and open many options for me after getting my degree.
