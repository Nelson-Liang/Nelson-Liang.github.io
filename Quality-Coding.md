## Why is coding standards important? 
Coding writing can be like a formal dinner. Although you are free to create your own meal and eat it however you like, there are some guidelines you needed to follow in order to look presentable around others. I agree that it is important to have a software engineering technique that improves the quality of a person’s work. Have strong knowledge in coding etiquette is just as important as creating the codes. A software engineer needs to find a balance between producing results and formatting a clean workspace. You want to build an elegant script for anyone to comfortable read and easily understand. When a programmer lacks the importance of a coding standard, it can be quite difficult for an audience to quickly acknowledge the function of the code. If a coding script is not neat, it can cause problems for a team to implement the code or in a classroom where students will have a hard time understanding. This is why coding standards should be considered when writing a script.

## Experienced the mess
One experience I have that justifies the importance of following some source of a coding standard is on group projects. The final project for ICS 111, Introduction to Computer Science 1, was a group assignment where you team up in groups of 3 to 4 students and create a game or something that involves coding. I had an easy time work with my teammates, coming up with ideas and each of us providing the code necessary to complete the task, but one problem that stands out was organization. At the beginning of the assignment, we work individually to work on the major function we knew we wanted in the game. When the time came to implement all our work into one script, I realize I had a hard time identifying the functions because they were not labeled and some lines lack quality such as indents and space between words and numbers. In the end, we were able to organize and label all of the functions and classes. I learn that it is important to label your work so that others can recognize the purpose of the code.

## First impressions of ESLint with Intellij
ESLint with Intellij was a unique experience for me. Intellij is a coding program that can use a multitude of coding languages such as Javascript.  It was a rough beginning as I had a hard time setting up the Intellji’s project with the needed files and preferences as well as syncing it to Github. The submission process was longer compared to the jsfiddle as more than one file needs to be completed correctly and required a push from Github Desktop to the Online version. The green checkmark was useful as indicating an error, but I can’t seem to find the troubleshooting feature that shows where the problem is occurring without running it on a browser first. A good part of using ESLint with Intellij is that you can use it when offline and the storage in Github is better than that of jsfiddle.
