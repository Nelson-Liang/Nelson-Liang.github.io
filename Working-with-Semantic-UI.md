Semantic UI is an effective list of methods that can benefit a developer’s website. The list offers many functions that can improve the precision and quality of your work and grants a way to develop projects faster than normal codes. The learning process can be frustrating, but it is well worth the effort put into it. A programmer using Semantic UI may find the value of it due to the number of possibilities that can be accomplished with a simple UI command. Raw HTML and CSS are limited to its built-in features on web design and without specialize command to implement a certain appearance on your site, it can be chaotic in your coding script and difficult to meet the image the creator is looking for. 

Software engineers can benefit from learning the art of Semantic UI. One benefit is the learning process behind the list of methods and commands. A software engineer should always have a passion to improve their skills and find the opportunities to represent it. Learning new codes that be a game-changer when the time comes to it. A software engineer will never know when a situation requires the function of that specific code and with the store knowledge, it can be easier to fulfill the objective. Another benefit is the exposure that comes with knowledge. There is no better way to impress an employer or boss than to develop a website to show your past work and achievements. Creating your own website and publishing it can allow anyone to see your style and skills without meeting you face-to-face.

Semantic UI was a challenge for me to learn. First of all, many of the codes aren’t found in the HTML sheet itself. In order to find the different methods used by Semantic UI, I needed to look it up online, mainly on their site. I found it difficult to alter the code to achieve the image that I anticipated. One example is the movement of items and menus on the site. I couldn’t find a way to move the items or menus to a certain location and there wasn’t any resource to guide me through the basic benchmark of the material, so many of the changes were from experimenting with the tools I already have which show sign of ineffectiveness. One benefit of Semantic UI that I found useful is the multiple results that can be achieved with a single UI line. Once I learn the combination of commands or words in the UI, it produced the desired result in a section that remains organize and coding efficiency. Sematic is the only framework that I used, so I can’t compare it to any other similar framework features.
