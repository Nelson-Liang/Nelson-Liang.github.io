	Javascript is a brand new stage for me as I never attempt to experience it before starting this class. Javascript have a similar coding language as Java, but possess a few characteristics that make it unique. For example, I notice that Javascript uses less data type than Java as “let” can be used for both “int” and “string”. A strong difference between Java and Javascript is where the language is accessible. Java can run as a downloadable app or a browser while Javascript only runs in a browser. I feel that Javascript is a great platform for new as well as experienced programmers to conduct tasks or projects. The platform has an assist feature to direct the user to the source of the error for a much easier to troubleshoot and default color indication to separate different objects from one another. As a software engineer, it would be more comfortable using a platform like Javascript that is easy to learn and is capable of producing quality work. 
	
	Athletic software engineering is placing a programmer under stress to see how they perform. This is great in training and exercising the programmer’s ability to perform a task in a certain amount of time given. Workout of the Day or simply WOD is a daily exercise to place students under these types of stress. I personally don’t like these exercises because it is proven to be more stressful than enjoyable. I am not a quick thinker when it comes to problem-solving and I am not very knowledgeable in the language which is important because time doesn't stop for you so every move counts. I can’t say that WOD is not helpful because the task does test your knowledge and condition students for a career in software engineering. This style of learning can be intense, but it exercises your mind to think faster and show where you stand as a programmer.
